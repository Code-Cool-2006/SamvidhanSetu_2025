Problem Statement : Collaborative Local Legislation Hub

💡 Project Details (Simplified & Bullet Format)

🔍 Problem Description
    People struggle to understand local laws because they're full of complex legal terms.
    There’s no single platform to view, discuss, vote on, or track the progress of local bills.
    Citizens don’t have a simple way to give feedback or feel their voices are heard.
    This leads to low civic participation and limited trust in the system.
    Communities need a user-friendly platform to follow, understand, and engage in law-making.

💡 Solution Overview : 
    We’re building a central hub for civic participation.
    It helps users:
    Read AI-generated simple summaries of complicated laws
    Discuss bills in forums
    Submit structured feedback (support, oppose, or suggest changes)
    Vote securely and verify their votes
    Track a bill’s journey from idea to implementation
    A multilingual chatbot helps users understand content in their own language.
    The platform brings clarity, transparency, and involvement to local law-making.

🤖 Technology Stack : 
    Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, Next.js
    Backend: Node.js (Express) / FastAPI (Python)
    AI Tools: OpenAI API, LangChain, HuggingFace
    Database: Supabase / PostgreSQL
